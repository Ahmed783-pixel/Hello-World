# Project Experiences 

## Moon Landing Project :

• CAD modelling and fabrication of a 5x5x8 “ loading and unloading machine consisting of a rotating base , height adjustment, and an extension arm mechanism based             on principles of static mechanics

• Designing and conducting risk reduction tests for finding the maximum loading capacity and lift speed for the height adjustment mechanism

• Rapid Prototyping using Fusion 360 and hardware to detect early design flaws

## Knee Support Brace Design :

• Researched osteoarthritis disease in middle age groups , analysed anthropometric data , and conceptualised a knee joint support mechanism using a torsion coil spring system to reduce body weight loading at the joints by 25 % to prevent knee related injuries
